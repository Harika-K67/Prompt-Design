OPEC+ is set to hold a rescheduled meeting on Saturday to decide its oil output policy for June, moving it ahead of the originally planned Monday. Eight member countries are debating whether to implement a larger accelerated production increase or stick to a previously planned smaller rise. This comes after Saudi Arabia's push for a significant boost in May that contributed to oil prices dropping to a four-year low below $60 per barrel. The group is contemplating an increase of 411,000 barrels per day, tripling the amount agreed on in December. Tensions have emerged as Iraq and Kazakhstan reportedly exceeded their output targets, frustrating Saudi Arabia. Despite uncertainties in the market and falling prices, some members support continuing the aggressive output hike. OPEC+, which includes both OPEC members and allies like Russia, is currently cutting more than 5 million barrels per day. The full ministerial meeting of the group is scheduled for May 28. Market analysts recommend adhering more closely to the existing output reduction plan but warn of potential unexpected changes by the alliance.

OPEC+ has rescheduled its meeting to Saturday to decide on oil production levels for June, amid debates over accelerating output hikes versus adhering to a modest increase. This comes in the wake of Saudi Arabia's push for an aggressive hike in May, which led to a significant drop in oil prices. Tensions have escalated, particularly with Iraq and Kazakhstan's overproduction, sparking frustration from Riyadh. While some members support aggressive output increases despite lower prices and market uncertainties, analysts advise caution, emphasizing the potential impacts on global oil markets if the producer alliance deviates from existing plans.
